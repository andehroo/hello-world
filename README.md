# hello-world
Well this is all very confusing.

I'm Andrew. I do networking type stuff for a public sector organisation.
I'm trying to learn about Python, network automation, scripting, that sort of thing.
At some point in my 100 browser tab studying journey, I was advised to dive right in to Github, so here I am.

I enjoy drinking coffee, playing computer games, watching esoteric shite on youtube and the outdoors.
Overweight, mid-30s, gay, he/him. Happy most of the time.
